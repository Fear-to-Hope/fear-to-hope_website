  <h1>Fear to Hope</h1>
  <p>Ghost Forests. Species Extinction. Eco-Anxiety. Climate
  Crisis. These are what we fight.</p>
  <p>Coastal Resilience. Biodiversity. Climate Adapatation and
  Mitigation. These are what we seek.</p>
  <h2>Mission</h2>
  <div class="equalColumns">
  <p>Coastal ecosystems are biodiverse and perform many services
  valued by society. As a result of climate change, ghost forests
  (eerie gray stands of dead trees) are forming, shorelines are
  receding, and native habitats are being lost all along the
  Atlantic Coast. Fears of these impacts are well founded, but can
  serve to motivate science-based solutions that bring rational
  hope. Engaging and mentoring high school students in selected,
  authentic research efforts can simultaneously hasten the pace of
  research now, and widen the STEAM pipeline to ensure a workforce
  empowered to address the challenges of the future.</p>
