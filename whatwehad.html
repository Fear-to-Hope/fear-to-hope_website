  <h1>What We Had</h1>
  <p>Biodiversity, ecosystem functions, and Native American
  culture</p>
  <h2>Biodiversity</h2>

  <h2>Wetland Ecosystem Functions</h2>
  <div class="tiledBlurbs">
    <h3>Carbon Sequestration</h3>
    <p>Organic material containing carbon is trapped in peat
    because no oxygen is available for decomposition</p>
    <h3>Unique Habitat and Biodiversity</h3>
    <p>As a habitat frequently inundated with water, various plants
    and animals have adapted to live in these conditions not found
    elsewhere in the world</p>
    <h3>Buffer Storms and Floods</h3>
    <p>Wetland vegetation along coastlines prevents erosion by
    dampening wind and water strength before reaching inland
    communities</p>
    <h3>Improve Water Quality</h3>
    <p>Wetlands function as natural filters of sediment and
    pollutants before they reach larger bodies of water (Chesapeake
    Bay or Atlantic Ocean)</p>
  </div>
  <h2>Native American Culture</h2>
  <div class="twoColumns">
    <div>
      <h3>Nansemond Tribe</h3>
      <p>Prior to European colonists, the Nansemond Tribe inhabited
      the Nansemond River, a 20 mile long tributary of the James
      River in Virginia. This tribe was a part of the Powhatan
      paramount chiefdom, a coalition of approximately 30 tribes
      distributed around the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
      <p>In an effort to exploit the natural resources of the area,
      colonists displaced the Nansemond into surrounding areas.
      Some families assimilated to an English lifestyle, while
      others adhered to a traditional lifestyle in Norfolk County,
      VA.</p>
      <h3>Construction</h3>
      <p>Atlantic White Cedar logs were used to construct canoes
      and frame houses due to its light weight and resistance to
      decay.</p>
      <p>Spears, arrows, basket slings, and toboggans were also
      made with AWC wood.</p>
      <h3>Medicine</h3>
      <p>AWC twigs and bark were used to make herbal tea to treat
      headaches, coughs, pneumonia, colds, fever, sprains, and
      bruises.</p>
      <p>Wood powder poultice were used for exterior wounds.</p>

      "Native Americans making boats">
      <figcaption>
        Native Americans used a mixture of mud and straw to dig out
        trunks to craft boats that carried large loads yet glided
        easily through the water.
