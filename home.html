<h1>Fear to Hope</h1>
<p>Ghost Forests. Species Extinction. Eco-Anxiety. Climate Crisis. These are what we fight.</p>
<p>Coastal Resilience. Biodiversity. Climate Adapatation and Mitigation. These are what we seek.</p>

<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
Coastal ecosystems are biodiverse and perform many services valued by society. As a result of climate change, ghost forests (eerie gray stands of dead trees) are forming, shorelines are receding, and native habitats are being lost all along the Atlantic Coast. Fears of these impacts are well founded, but can serve to motivate science-based solutions that bring rational hope. Engaging and mentoring high school students in selected, authentic research efforts can simultaneously hasten the pace of research now, and widen the STEAM pipeline to ensure a workforce empowered to address the challenges of the future.
